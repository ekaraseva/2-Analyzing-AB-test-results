# Analyzing A/B test results
This project was completed as part of the course requirements of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree certification.

## Overview
This project analyses the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Getting Started
- Clone or download the repository.

### Prerequisites
- Python (3.6)
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Statsmodels
- Sklearn (LogisticRegression)

## Key findings
The null hypothesis can't be rejected, thus we fail to reject that the old page is better or the same as the new one.
